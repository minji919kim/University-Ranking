# University-Ranking

### There are many useful world university ranking websites, but I always would like them to have more functionalities, such as letting users select a list of colleges and compare one another. In the project, I made my own visualization tool which students and their parents can get the data they want to have more easily.
### Selenium in Python is used to scrape a list of universities in top 2000 over the world and their information, and SQL and Tableau are used for data standard and visualization.
